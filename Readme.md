# Dev Trolling:
"I am not crazy! I know he swapped those kernel numbers. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just - I just couldn't prove it. He covered his tracks, he got that idiot at the render farm to lie for him. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? He's done worse. That interview! Are you telling me that a man just happens to get approved? No! He orchestrated it! Jimmy! He made a GIMP ripoff! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. I took him into my own startup! What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn't keep his hands out of the VPN router! But not our Jimmy! Couldn't be precious Jimmy! Sussing them blind! And HE gets to be a developer? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance!"
